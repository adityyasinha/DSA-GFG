/*Given a board of dimensions n Ã— m that needs to be cut into n*m squares. The cost of making a cut along a horizontal or vertical edge is provided in two arrays:

x[]: Cutting costs along the vertical edges (length-wise).
y[]: Cutting costs along the horizontal edges (width-wise).
Find the minimum total cost required to cut the board into squares optimally.
